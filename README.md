# Setup 
1. To install the necessary packages uses in `server.py`, run the following command in the root directory of this project: `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`, where `<env>` is your desired name of the environment. 
2. Run `conda activate <env>` to activate this environment. 
3. Run `export FLASK_APP=server` to set the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to `server.py`. 
3. Run `flask run` to start the server. 

I will add a more concise description later of how our application works replacing the onboarding screen from our previous application as well as describing how to use the actual program itself.
